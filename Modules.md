**MODULES :**

The diabetes prediction project is a Python-based machine learning project, and it
uses several Python libraries and modules to perform various tasks.
Some of the main modules used in this project -

➔ **Pandas :** Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and
preprocessing. It offers data structures and functions for efficiently working with
structured data, including data loading, cleaning, and transformation. In the
diabetes prediction project, Pandas is used to load the dataset, clean and
preprocess the data, and prepare it for analysis.

➔ **Numpy :** NumPy is another essential Python library that is used for numerical
operations and array processing. It offers powerful data structures and functions
for working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, making it ideal for
scientific computing and data analysis. In the diabetes prediction project, NumPy
is used for data manipulation and feature engineering.

➔ **Scikit-learn :** Scikit-learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning. It
offers a broad range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms,
including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
Scikit-learn also provides a wide range of evaluation metrics for measuring the
performance of machine learning models. In the diabetes prediction project,
Scikit-learn is used for training and testing the machine learning models and
evaluating their performance.

➔ **Matplotlib :** Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for data visualization. It
offers a range of tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
in Python. In the diabetes prediction project, Matplotlib is used for creating
visualizations of the data and the results of the machine learning models.
