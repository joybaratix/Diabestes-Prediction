**INTRODUCTION :**
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early
diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and improve patient
outcomes. In this project, we aim to predict the likelihood of a person developing
diabetes using machine learning algorithms. We use a publicly available dataset
containing information about patients' health status, including demographics,
medical history, and lifestyle factors. Our goal is to develop a model that can
accurately predict diabetes risk, which can be used by healthcare professionals to
identify high-risk patients and provide appropriate interventions. This project uses
Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries, such as
Scikit-learn and Pandas, to preprocess the data, train and evaluate different models,
and make predictions.


**OBJECTIVE :**
The objective of a diabetes prediction project is to develop a machine learning model
that can accurately predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes. This
model can be used to identify high-risk individuals and provide appropriate
interventions to prevent or delay the onset of the disease. Some specific objectives
of a this project âž” 
1. Preprocessing the data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Selection
5. Model Evaluation
6. Deployment
