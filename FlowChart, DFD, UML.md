As shown in the flowchart, the system has the following steps:
1. Load the diabetes dataset from a CSV file.
2. Preprocess the dataset by cleaning, normalizing, and scaling the data.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a machine learning model on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model on the testing data to determine its accuracy.
6. Use the trained model to predict whether a new patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.
7. Output the prediction result to the user.

As shown in the DFD, the system has four main components:
1. Data Input: The user inputs the patient's medical data into the system via a CSV file.
2. Data Preprocessing: The system preprocesses the input data by cleaning, normalizing,
and scaling the data.
3. Machine Learning Model: The preprocessed data is fed into a machine learning model,
which trains on the data and generates a prediction.
4. Data Output: The prediction is outputted to the user in the form of a binary classification result
(diabetic or non-diabetic)
