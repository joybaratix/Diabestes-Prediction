**LIMITATIONS OF THE PROJECT :**

**Limited Dataset :** The dataset used in the project is relatively small, with only 768
observations. This may limit the accuracy of the machine learning models and their
ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

**Limited Features :** The dataset used in the project contains only eight features, which
may not be enough to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes. Additional
relevant features, such as lifestyle factors, medical history, and genetic information,
could be included to improve the accuracy of the models.

**Limited Scope :** The project focuses only on predicting the likelihood of diabetes
based on a limited set of factors. It does not provide any medical advice or treatment
recommendations for individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes.

**Data Imbalance :** The dataset used in the project is imbalanced, with only few of the
observations having diabetes. This can lead to bias in the machine learning models
and limit their ability to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes.

**Lack of Real-time Data :** The project uses a static dataset that may not reflect
real-time data. It does not consider the latest trends, lifestyles, or environmental
factors that could affect diabetes risk.

**Lack of Interpretability :** Some machine learning models used in the project, such as
the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, are considered "black-box"
models, meaning it can be challenging to interpret how they arrived at their
predictions. This may limit the ability of healthcare providers to explain the reasoning
behind the predictions to patients.
